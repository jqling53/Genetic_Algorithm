Create a package in R to implement a genetic algorithm used for variable selection in regression analysis.

To be able to run tests install package with the following command: 
R CMD INSTALL GA_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz --install-tests

R code for each step of the algorithm can be found at https://github.com/jqling53/Genetic_Algorithm/tree/main/GA/R
